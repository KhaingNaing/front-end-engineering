# User Experience UX
- The useability of an app (Does the app feel logical?)
- Who are the users?
- User research (interviews, tests)

# User Interface UI
- The graphics and copy-writing
- Visual design: colors, pixels, shadows etc
- The "branding" of an app

# Aim of UI: Making apps easier
- ensuring users aren't scared (basic visual design principles)
- make it easier to find things (visual hierarchy)
- make it easier to do something (affordances)

## Part One: Graphic Basics
* Alignment
    - Using a grid helps great alignment
* Fonts
    - Less is more (consistent fonts)
* Colors
    - Use maths for colors that look great together (use harmonious set of colors)

## Part Two: Help people find things
* Use visual hierarchy to make what is most important stand out 
* Elements of Visual Hierarchy
    1. Size (bigger means important)
    2. Color (brighter means important)
    3. Contrast (contrasting things draw attention)
    4. Spacing (big margins create importance)
    5. Alignment (misaligned things draw attention)
    6. Repetition (puts things on the same level)

## Part Three: Affordances (Help people use things)
* An affordance is the visual properties of an element that let the user know they can do something with it.
e.g. button on a web page
* Types of Affordances:
    - Explicit
        Explicitly tells people how to interact with things
        e.g. "Click here" to do something
    - Pattern
        A pattern affordance uses a common pattern to imply an interaction is possible
        e.g. Underlined blue text implies a link
    - False
        A false affordance looks like it would do something it can't do 
        (AVOID THIS)
