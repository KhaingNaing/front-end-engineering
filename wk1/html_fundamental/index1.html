<!--
    IMP: 
        Base64 Encoding:
            Instead of loading an image as a resource via http, directly encode the image into the page of API response.
            Pros: reduces subsequent load time (#http_connections required)
            Cons: increases initial load time (increase overall amount of data needing to be processed)
            - Commonly used for small images 

    Two key categories: 
    1. Vector images
        - do not distort when enlarged
        - e.g SVM

    2. Raster images
        - when enlarged, the origin image is stretched leading to a lower quality image
        - BMP (variable format): no compression or uses    (called bit map)
        - GIF (8 bit format): yes lossless compression, Use in image animations
        - JPG (24 bit): yes lossy compression, high resolution photos
        - PNG (16-24 bit): yes lossless compression, most non-photo use cases
