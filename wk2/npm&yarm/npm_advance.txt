NPM:
    - a package management system for js applications
    - allows installing dependencies from the web 

npm install 
    - install new dependencies
npm start 
    - start applications
package.json
    - file that contains metadata about your application and exists in root dir 
    - semantic versioning 
        - specification of your package's current version 
        - Major: change in major ver means you changed the API in a breaking way
        - Minor: change in minor means you added functions in a backwards compatible manner
        - Patch: change in patch means you made backwards compatible bug fixes
dependency types
    - dependency: modules required by app to run (e.g. react)
    - devDependencies: modules required during development but not for run (e.g. jest)
    - peerDependencies
    - optionalDependencies
scripts
    - allows to specify command line scripts to run with npm

Yarn:
    - alternative to NPM (released by facebook and has a few adv)
    - significantly faster
    - used deterministic install algorithm
    - used lockfiles which record exact versions of each dependency that has been installed
