The structure of NPM involves a few key files and folders.

- package.json
where meta data about the project is stored, include a list of dependencies to install
*changes always committed to git*

- package-lock.json
where version information about dependencies is stored, to ensure everyone has the right versions
*changes always committed to git*

- node_modules/
where the dependencies are installed locally
*changes are NEVER committed to git*
