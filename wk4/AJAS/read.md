# Client-Server Interaction 
* Client: smart phone, laptop etc
* Server: Racks of machines in datacenters
e.g. one server vs multiple clients 
or multiple clients sending request or receiving response from multiple servers 

* Client-side: 
    - low latency is most important 

* Server-side: 
    - Max throughput is most important
