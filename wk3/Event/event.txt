What is an Event?
- signal that a thing has happened to a DOM element
    - thing could be:
        Mouse events (click, dblclick, mouseup, mousedown, mouseenter, mouseleave)
        Keyboard events (keydown, keypress, keyup)
        more! (submit, load, error etc)
- can use events to run js code in response to user actions

Event handlers
    User interacts with page => event occurs => piece of JS code is run

Ways to Adding Event Handler 
1) in html
    <input 
        value='Click me'
        onclick="alert('Clicked!')"
        type="button"
    >
2) DOM Property 
    let element = document.getElementById('btn');
    // onclick is a callback function 
    element.onclick = () => {
        alert('Button was clicked!');
    };
3) addEventListener
    target.addEventListener(
        type,       // e.g. 'click'
        listener,   // the callback
        [options]   // obj that specifies extra setting for event listener
    )

    e.g. 
    let element = document.getElementById('btn');
    let handler = () => {
        alert('button was clicked');
    };
    element.addEventListener('click', handler);
    element.removeEventListener('click', handler);

Event Interface 
The parameter to an event handler is an event obj
- document.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {
    ...
})
- event obj represents the event that has taken place and has properties describing event details
- Event interface properties:
    - event.currentTarget       // current event handler is running on 
    - event.timeStamp           // time the event was created (in ms)
    - event.type                // name of the event e.g. 'click'
    Note: diff types of events has specific properties

The Event Loop
- the event loop is a single-threaded loop which runs in the browser and manages all events
- when an event is triggered it is added to the queue and will not run until current event is run-to-completion

Event Capturing and Bubbling
1) event capturing phase: window -> document -> elemnt ... -> target_element
After reaching the target
2) event bubbling phase: from target all the way back to window
