How code is included
- Linking js externally
    - improve in performance when browser cache is utilised
    - reduces time taken for initial html to be revised 

- Linking js inline
    - avoid network requests (potentially costly) for script if file is not yet loaded 
    - include at the bottom of the body tag normally because you want your page to render first and execute js slowly after
